The Chinese laborers worked out well and thousands more were recruited until the railroad 's completion in 1869 . Chinese labor provided the massive labor needed to build the majority of the Central Pacific 's difficult railroad tracks through the Sierra Nevada mountains and across Nevada . The Chinese population rose from 2,716 in 1851 to 63,000 by 1871 . In the decade 1861 -- 70 , 64,301 were recorded as arriving , followed by 123,201 in 1871 -- 80 and 61,711 in 1881 -- 90 . 77 % were located in California , with the rest scattered across the West , the South , and New England . Most came from Southern China looking for a better life ; escaping a high rate of poverty left after the Taiping Rebellion . This immigration may have been as high as 90 % male as most immigrated with the thought of returning home to start a new life . Those that stayed in America faced the lack of suitable Chinese brides as Chinese women were not allowed to emigrate in significant numbers after 1872 . As a result , the mostly bachelor communities slowly aged in place with very low Chinese birth rates . </P>\n","7169278318001535694 SHORT ANSWER:  1860s\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":[" 56%|█████▌    | 172154/307372 [02:29<01:02, 2179.37it/s]"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["4670874965641440246 NO ANSWER\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":[" 59%|█████▉    | 180959/307372 [02:38<01:01, 2042.69it/s]"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["7949542538161903619 NO ANSWER\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":[" 62%|██████▏   | 191380/307372 [02:47<01:09, 1667.17it/s]"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["-1008973731705801750 LONG ANSWER:  <P> Early emigrants once called the California Trail an elephant , due to the difficult journey .

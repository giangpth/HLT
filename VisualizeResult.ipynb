Females possess spermathecae except for the species Sickius longibulbi and Encyocratella olivacea . Males have much shorter lifespans than females because they die relatively soon after maturing . Few live long enough for a postultimate molt , which is unlikely in natural habitats because they are vulnerable to predation , but has happened in captivity , though rarely . Most males do not live through this molt , as they tend to get their emboli , mature male sexual organs on pedipalps , stuck in the molt . Most tarantula fanciers regard females as more desirable as pets due to their much longer lifespans .

The spot is the 25 - yard line in both college and professional football on kickoffs and free kicks after a safety , with the NCAA having changed from the 20 in 2012 and the NFL making the same change in 2018 . The NCAA made a further rule change effective in its 2018 season , treating a fair catch on a kickoff , or free kick following a safety , between the receiving team 's goal line and 25 - yard line as a touchback . All other touchback situations in both rule sets result in possession at the 20 . In arena football , and other indoor football games , a touchback results in the team awarded the touchback receiving the football at its own 3 - yard line . This can result from any of the above events except for punting , which is not a part of arena football . ( In arena football , a kicked ball usually bounces back into play off of the rebound nets , but the above can still occur when the ball lands in the slack nets behind the goalposts after a kickoff , passes under the rebound nets and out of play , or in the event of fumbles and interceptions . ) $<tag>$\n","\\item SHORT:  The spot is the 25 - yard line\n"," \\end{itemize}\n","\\item\n","\\begin{itemize}\n","\\item QUESTION:  who did the tv coverage play by play announcer for super bowl lii\n","\\item LONG:  $<tag>$ $<tag>$ LII $<tag>$ $<tag>$ February 4 , 2018 $<tag>$ $<tag>$ NBC $<tag>$ $<tag>$ Al Michaels $<tag>$ $<tag>$ Cris Collinsworth $<tag>$ $<tag>$ Michele Tafoya $<tag>$ $<tag>$ Dan Patrick and Liam McHugh $<tag>$ $<tag>$ Tony Dungy , Rodney Harrison and John Harbaugh $<tag>$ $<tag>$ Dan Patrick $<tag>$ $<tag>$\n","\\item SHORT:  NBC $<tag>$ $<tag>$ Al Michaels $<tag>$ $<tag>$ Cris\n"," \\end{itemize}\n","\\item\n","\\begin{itemize}\n","\\item QUESTION:  where are you going where have you gone\n","\\item LONG:  $<tag>$ `` Where Are You Going , Where Have You Been ?

Georgia did not send representatives to the First Continental Congress that met in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , in 1774 . The Congress asked all colonies to form a group , called the Association , to ban trade with Great Britain . Georgia delegates gathered in a provincial congress in Savannah on January 18 , 1775 , to discuss whether to join the Association , and to elect representatives to the Second Continental Congress . Those who were elected declined to go to Philadelphia , however , because the delegates were divided on the action to be taken .

Headrights are most notable for their role in the expansion of the thirteen British colonies in North America ; the Virginia Company of London gave headrights to settlers , and the Plymouth Company followed suit . The headright system was used in several colonies , including Maryland , Georgia , North Carolina and South Carolina . Most headrights were for 1 to 1,000 acres ( 4.0 km ) of land , and were given to anyone willing to cross the Atlantic Ocean and help populate the colonies . Headrights were granted to anyone who would pay for the transportation costs of a laborer or slaves . These land grants consisted of 50 acres ( 200,000 m ) for someone newly moving to the area and 100 acres ( 0.40 km ) for people previously living in the area . By giving the land to the landowning masters the indentured servants had little or no chance to procure their own land .

As with most philosophically - driven disciplines , the concept of justice differs in every culture . An early theory of justice was set out by the Ancient Greek philosopher Plato in his work The Republic . Advocates of divine command theory say that justice issues from God . In the 17th century , theorists like John Locke advocated natural rights as a derivative of justice . Thinkers in the social contract tradition state that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone concerned . In the 19th century , utilitarian thinkers including John Stuart Mill said that justice is what has the best consequences . Theories of distributive justice concern what is distributed , between whom they are to be distributed , and what is the proper distribution . Egalitarians state that justice can only exist within the coordinates of equality . John Rawls used a theory of social contract to show that justice , and especially distributive justice , is a form of fairness . Property rights theorists ( like Robert Nozick ) take a deontological view of distributive justice and state that property rights - based justice maximizes the overall wealth of an economic system . Theories of retributive justice are concerned with punishment for wrongdoing . Restorative justice ( also sometimes called `` reparative justice '' ) is an approach to justice that focuses on restoring what is good , and necessarily focuses on the needs of victims and offenders . $<tag>$\n","\\item SHORT:  \n"," \\end{itemize}\n","\\item\n","\\begin{itemize}\n","\\item QUESTION:  when did the roman empire move its capital\n","\\item LONG:  $<tag>$ Byzantium took on the name of Kōnstantinoupolis ( `` city of Constantine '' , Constantinople ) after its refoundation under Roman emperor Constantine I , who transferred the capital of the Roman Empire to Byzantium in 330 and designated his new capital officially as Nova Roma ( Νέα Ῥώμη ) ' New Rome ' .

Accompanying a musical sequence during which Anya travels from her Russian orphanage to St. Petersberg , the song incorporates the film 's central themes about home , love and family . $<tag>$\n","\\item SHORT:  Liz Callaway\n"," \\end{itemize}\n","\\item\n","\\begin{itemize}\n","\\item QUESTION:  who won the war between athens and sparta\n","\\item LONG:  $<tag>$ $<tag>$ Result $<tag>$ $<tag>$ Peloponnesian League victory $<tag>$ $<tag>$\n","\\item SHORT:  \n"," \\end{itemize}\n","\\item\n","\\begin{itemize}\n","\\item QUESTION:  most viewed youtube music video in 24 hours record\n","\\item LONG:  \n","\\item SHORT:  \n"," \\end{itemize}\n","\\item\n","\\begin{itemize}\n","\\item QUESTION:  game of thrones takes place in what year\n","\\item LONG:  $<tag>$ Game of Thrones has attracted record viewership on HBO and has a broad , active , international fan base .

Sieve elements are the major conducting cells in phloem . Conducting cells aid in transport of molecules especially for long - distance signaling . In plant anatomy , there are two main types of sieve elements which are sieve cells and sieve tube members . Sieve cells are specialized cells in the phloem tissue of flowering plants . Companion cells and Sieve cells originate from meristems , which are tissues that actively divide throughout a plant 's lifetime . They are similar to the development of xylem , a water conducting cells in plants whose main function is also transportation in the plant vascular system . Sieve elements ' major function includes transporting sugars over long distance through plants by acting as a channel . Sieve elements elongate cells containing sieve areas on their walls . Pores on sieve areas allow for cytoplasmic connections to neighboring cells , which allows for the movement of photosynthetic material and other organic molecules necessary for tissue function . Structurally , they are elongated and parallel to the organ or tissue that they are located in . Sieve elements typically lack a nucleus and contain none to a very small number of ribosomes . The two types of sieve elements , sieve tube members and sieve cells , have different structure . Sieve tube members are shorter and wider with greater area for nutrient transport while sieve cells tend to be longer and narrower with smaller area for nutrient transport . Although the function of both of these kinds of sieve elements is the same , sieve cells are found in gymnosperms , non-flowering vascular plants , while sieve tube members are found in angiosperms , flowering vascular plants . $<tag>$\n","\\item SHORT:  \n"," \\end{itemize}\n","\\item\n","\\begin{itemize}\n","\\item QUESTION:  break for the german border top gear full episode\n","\\item LONG:  \n","\\item SHORT:  \n"," \\end{itemize}\n","\\item\n","\\begin{itemize}\n","\\item QUESTION:  how much does the us and china trade\n","\\item LONG:  $<tag>$ US President Donald Trump had promised in his campaign to fix China 's `` longtime abuse of the broken international system and unfair practices '' . The United States of America filed a request for consultation to the World Trade Organization , in regard to concerns that the People 's Republic of China was violating intellectual property rights . The U.S. administration is relying partly on Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 to prevent what it claims are unfair trade practices and theft of intellectual property . This gives the president the authority to unilaterally impose fines or other penalties on a trading partner if it is deemed to be unfairly harming U.S. business interests . Trump had already , in August 2017 , opened a formal investigation into attacks on the intellectual property of the U.S. and its allies , which cost the U.S. alone an estimated $225 -- 600 billion a year . As a result of the findings of the US Trade Representative Section 301 Investigation into China , the United States claims that China enforces laws that allow them to legally avoid certain terms previously laid out by The Agreement on Trade - Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ( TRIPS ) . In summary , the United States believes that certain Chinese laws counteract intellectual property rights by forcing foreign companies to engage in joint ventures with Chinese companies , in which their new Chinese partners are granted access and permission to use , improve , or replicate their technologies . In addition , the United States argues that China is not compliant in recognizing legitimate patents and that their policies discriminate against foreign imported technology . Aside from the United States , several other nations have filed requests for consultation in regard to suspicions of Chinese violations , such as the European Union , Japan , Saudi Arabia , and Ukraine . $<tag>$\n","\\item SHORT:  \n"," \\end{itemize}\n","\\item\n","\\begin{itemize}\n","\\item QUESTION:  habersham county mud creek precinct in northeastern georgia\n","\\item LONG:  $<tag>$ $<tag>$ North : Batesville , Cool Springs , Fair Play , Deep Creek , Glade Creek , Fork , Falling Water , Clarkesville $<tag>$ $<tag>$ South : Demorest , Center Hill , Cornelia , View , Mud Creek and Baldwin $<tag>$ $<tag>$\n","\\item SHORT:  \n"," \\end{itemize}\n","\\item\n","\\begin{itemize}\n","\\item QUESTION:  what is k to 12 program of deped\n","\\item LONG:  $<tag>$ K - 12 is a program that covers kindergarten and 12 years of basic education to provide sufficient time for mastery of concepts and skills , develop lifelong learners , and prepare graduates for tertiary education , middle - level skills development , employment , and entrepreneurship . $<tag>$\n","\\item SHORT:  \n"," \\end{itemize}\n","\\item\n","\\begin{itemize}\n","\\item QUESTION:  what is the website of swachh bharat mission\n","\\item LONG:  $<tag>$ $<tag>$ Website $<tag>$ $<tag>$ swachhbharat.mygov.in $<tag>$ $<tag>$\n","\\item SHORT:  swachhbharat.mygov.in\n"," \\end{itemize}\n","\\item\n","\\begin{itemize}\n","\\item QUESTION:  how many us presidents served in the civil war\n","\\item LONG:  $<tag>$ Eight presidents served during World War II , while seven served in the military during the American Civil War . $<tag>$\n","\\item SHORT:  seven\n"," \\end{itemize}\n","\\item\n","\\begin{itemize}\n","\\item QUESTION:  describe the three false conclusions of adolescent egocentrism\n","\\item LONG:  $<tag>$ Although egocentrism and narcissism appear similar , they are not the same .

India does not have an official state religion . In matters of law in modern India , however , the applicable code of law is unequal , and India 's personal laws - on matters such as marriage , divorce , inheritance , alimony - varies with an individual 's religion . Muslim Indians have Sharia - based Muslim Personal Law , while Hindu , Christian and Sikh Indians live under common law .

Based on the model postal system introduced in England by the reformer , Rowland Hill , efficient postal services were provided at a low cost and enabled the smooth commercial , military and administrative functioning of the EIC and its successor , the British Raj . The Imperial Posts co-existed with the several postal systems maintained by various Indian states , some of which produced stamps for use within their respective dominions , while British Indian postage stamps were required for sending mail beyond the boundaries of these states .

For foreign countries , the process is regulated by treaty and conducted between the federal government of the United States and the government of a foreign country . The process is considerably different from interstate or intrastate extradition . Florida , Alaska , and Hawaii do not extradite for a misdemeanor conviction that was convicted in the US , as of 2010 . Some felonies are an exception in American law such as a crime that is violent in nature , or a sexual offense , or felony driving while intoxicated ; they will entail extradition from all states in the United States . Theft charges and small drug crimes are the exception ; for instance , if a minor crime is committed in Florida , a person apprehended in Idaho will not be extradited back to the original crime 's jurisdiction . Federal charges are governed by US federal law and most states , with the exceptions of South Carolina and Missouri , have adopted the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act . In practice , Florida , Alaska , and Hawaii typically do not extradite if the crime in question is not a felony because of the associated costs of transporting the suspect and the housing fees that must be paid to the jurisdiction in which he is held until transported . $<tag>$\n","\\item SHORT:  \n"," \\end{itemize}\n","\\item\n","\\begin{itemize}\n","\\item QUESTION:  who is the statue of libertys face modeled after\n","\\item LONG:  $<tag>$ Bartholdi 's early models were all similar in concept : a female figure in neoclassical style representing liberty , wearing a stola and pella ( gown and cloak , common in depictions of Roman goddesses ) and holding a torch aloft .

What is clear is that `` Niger '' was an appellation applied in the Mediterranean world from at least the Classical era , when knowledge of the area by Europeans was slightly better than fable . A careful study of Classical writings on the interior of the Sahara begins with Ptolemy , who mentions two rivers in the desert : the `` Gir '' ( Γειρ ) and farther south , the `` Nigir '' ( Νιγειρ ) . The first has been since identified as the Wadi Ghir on the north western edge of the Tuat , along the borders of modern Morocco and Algeria . This would likely have been as far as Ptolemy would have had consistent records . The Ni - Ger was likely speculation , although the name stuck as that of a river south of the Mediterranean 's `` known world '' . Suetonius reports Romans traveling to the `` Ger '' , although in reporting any river 's name derived from a Berber language , in which `` gher '' means `` watercourse '' , confusion could easily arise . Pliny connected these two rivers as one long watercourse which flowed ( via lakes and underground sections ) into the Nile , a notion which persisted in the Arab and European worlds -- and further added the Senegal River as the `` Ger '' -- until the 19th century . The connection to the Nile River was made not simply because this was then known as the great river of `` Aethiopia '' ( by which all lands south of the desert were called by Classical writers ) , but because the Nile flooded every summer . In Europe and Western Asia , floods are expected in the Spring , following snow melt . Classical authors explained the summer flood by calculating the time it took for flood waters to move down a river , and calculating how long the Nile must have been for the waters to travel from a mountain range in the spring . However the cycle of the Nile is influenced by tropical rain patterns instead of by melting snow , a characteristic unknown to the Classical Mediterranean world . Through the descriptions of Leo Africanus and even Ibn Battuta -- despite his visit to the river -- the myth connecting the Niger to the Nile persisted . $<tag>$\n","\\item SHORT:  \n"," \\end{itemize}\n","\\item\n","\\begin{itemize}\n","\\item QUESTION:  thank god i'm a country boy song\n","\\item LONG:  $<tag>$ `` Thank God I 'm a Country Boy '' , also known as `` Country Boy '' , is a song written by John Martin Sommers and recorded by American singer / songwriter John Denver . $<tag>$\n","\\item SHORT:  \n"," \\end{itemize}\n","\\item\n","\\begin{itemize}\n","\\item QUESTION:  richest country in africa by gdp per capita\n","\\item LONG:  $<tag>$ $<tag>$ $<tag>$ $<tag>$ 37 $<tag>$ $<tag>$ 34,865 $<tag>$ $<tag>$ Equatorial Guinea $<tag>$ $<tag>$ 2.5 $<tag>$ $<tag>$ 56.5 $<tag>$ $<tag>$ 45 $<tag>$ $<tag>$ 2017 est . $<tag>$ $<tag>$ 30,807 $<tag>$ $<tag>$ 7.391 $<tag>$ $<tag>$\n","\\item SHORT:  \n"," \\end{itemize}\n","\\item\n","\\begin{itemize}\n","\\item QUESTION:  who sang the theme tune to quantum of solace\n","\\item LONG:  $<tag>$ Mark Ronson and Amy Winehouse recorded a demo track for the film , but Ronson explained that she was `` not ready to record any music '' at that time .

As executive producer of the American series and creator of the original British series , Gervais stated on his blog that the line was inserted as a metajoke was intended as `` a little in - joke '' . Near the beginning of the episode , Deangelo compares Meredith Palmer 's ( Kate Flannery ) house to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina . Michael notes that `` When Larry King died , they did n't just cancel his show '' , showing that Michael is unaware that Larry King is not deceased . Later , he notes that `` they got Piers Morgan to come in and do his show '' instead . The final song that the office sings to Michael is a parody of `` Seasons of Love '' from the Broadway musical Rent . Dwight later reveals in a talking head that he is always the padawan learner , and never a Jedi knight , a reference to the 1977 film Star Wars and its franchise . Michael notes that he wanted his last Dundies celebration to be like the 1990 film The Godfather Part III , rather than the `` confusing '' 1972 film The Godfather I , which he notes had `` three big laughs '' . Additionally , the episode contains several references to the film The King 's Speech , notably during the scene in which Deangelo gives his speech at the Dundies while listening to his Walkman played at a high volume . $<tag>$\n","\\item SHORT:  \n"," \\end{itemize}\n","\\item\n","\\begin{itemize}\n","\\item QUESTION:  song only in america by brooks and dunn\n","\\item LONG:  $<tag>$ `` Only in America '' is a song recorded by American country music duo Brooks & Dunn .

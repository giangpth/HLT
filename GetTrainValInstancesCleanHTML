( SE5000 ) 9546 The solar eclipse of August 21 , 2017 , dubbed `` The Great American Eclipse '' by the media , was a total solar eclipse visible within a band across the entire contiguous United States , passing from the Pacific to the Atlantic coasts . As a partial solar eclipse , it was visible on land from Nunavut in northern Canada to as far south as northern South America . In northwestern Europe and Africa , it was partially visible in the late evening . In Asia , it was visible only at the eastern extremity , the Chukchi Peninsula . Play media Video of the eclipse second contact in Simpsonville , South Carolina . Crowd reaction is heard on audio . Prior to this event , no solar eclipse had been visible across the entire contiguous United States since June 8 , 1918 ; not since the February 1979 eclipse had a total eclipse been visible from anywhere in the mainland United States . The path of totality touched 14 states , and the rest of the U.S. had a partial eclipse . The area of the path of totality was about 16 percent of the area of the United States , with most of this area over the ocean , not land . The event 's shadow began to cover land on the Oregon coast as a partial eclipse at 4 : 05 p.m. UTC ( 9 : 05 a.m. PDT ) , with the total eclipse beginning there at 5 : 16 p.m. UTC ( 10 : 16 a.m. PDT ) ; the total eclipse 's land coverage ended along the South Carolina coast at about 6 : 44 p.m. UTC ( 2 : 44 p.m. EDT ) . Visibility as a partial eclipse in Honolulu , Hawaii began with sunrise at 4 : 20 p.m. UTC ( 6 : 20 a.m. HST ) and ended by 5 : 25 p.m. UTC ( 7 : 25 a.m. HST ) .\", 'start': 25, 'stop': 29, 'target': 'SHORT'}\n","{'example_id': '4706363175863681196', 'part_id': 105, 'question': 'when do the eclipse supposed to take place', 'context': \"commemorated on a Forever Stamp '' .

Kant argued for the establishment of a peaceful world community , not in a sense of a global government , but in the hope that each state would declare itself a free state that respects its citizens and welcomes foreign visitors as fellow rational beings , thus promoting peaceful society worldwide . International co-operation to promote collective security originated in the Concert of Europe that developed after the Napoleonic Wars in the 19th century in an attempt to maintain the status quo between European states and so avoid war . This period also saw the development of international law , with the first Geneva Conventions establishing laws dealing with humanitarian relief during wartime , and the international Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes . As historians William H. Harbaugh and Ronald E. Powaski point out , Theodore Roosevelt was the first American President to call for an international league . At the acceptance for his Nobel Prize , Roosevelt said : `` it would be a masterstroke if those great powers honestly bent on peace would form a League of Peace . '' The forerunner of the League of Nations , the Inter-Parliamentary Union ( IPU ) , was formed by the peace activists William Randal Cremer and Frédéric Passy in 1889 ( and is currently still in existence as an international body with a focus on the various elected legislative bodies of the world . ) The IPU was founded with an international scope , with a third of the members of parliaments ( in the 24 countries that had parliaments ) serving as members of the IPU by 1914 . Its foundational aims were to encourage governments to solve international disputes by peaceful means . Annual conferences were established to help governments refine the process of international arbitration . Its structure was designed as a council headed by a president , which would later be reflected in the structure of the League . Initial proposals ( edit ) Lord Bryce , one of the earliest advocates for a League of Nations . At the start of the First World War the first schemes for international organisation to prevent future wars began to gain considerable public support , particularly in Great Britain and the United States . Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson , a British political scientist , coined the term `` League of Nations '' in 1914 and drafted a scheme for its organisation . Together with Lord Bryce , he played a leading role in the founding of the group of internationalist pacifists known as the Bryce Group , later the League of Nations Union .

The proposals were approved by the British government , and much of the commission 's results were later incorporated into the Covenant of the League of Nations . Jan Smuts helped to draft the Covenant of the League of Nations . The French also drafted a much more far - reaching proposal in June 1918 ; they advocated annual meetings of a council to settle all disputes , as well as an `` international army '' to enforce its decisions . The American President Woodrow Wilson instructed Edward M. House to draft a US plan which reflected Wilson 's own idealistic views ( first articulated in the Fourteen Points of January 1918 ) , as well as the work of the Phillimore Commission . The outcome of House 's work , and Wilson 's own first draft , proposed the termination of `` unethical '' state behaviour , including forms of espionage and dishonesty .

'' All states were required to submit complaints for arbitration or judicial inquiry before going to war . The Executive Council would create a Permanent Court of International Justice to make judgements on the disputes . Despite Wilson 's efforts to establish and promote the League , for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October 1919 , the United States never joined .

The special functions of the Assembly included the admission of new members , the periodical election of non-permanent members to the Council , the election with the Council of the judges of the Permanent Court , and control of the budget . In practice , the Assembly was the general directing force of League activities . The League Council acted as a type of executive body directing the Assembly 's business . It began with four permanent members ( Great Britain , France , Italy , and Japan ) and four non-permanent members that were elected by the Assembly for a three - year term . The first non-permanent members were Belgium , Brazil , Greece , and Spain . The composition of the Council was changed several times . The number of non-permanent members was first increased to six on 22 September 1922 and to nine on 8 September 1926 . Werner Dankwort of Germany pushed for his country to join the League ; joining in 1926 , Germany became the fifth permanent member of the Council . Later , after Germany and Japan both left the League , the number of non-permanent seats was increased from nine to eleven , and the Soviet Union was made a permanent member giving the Council a total of fifteen members . The Council met , on average , five times a year and in extraordinary sessions when required . In total , 107 sessions were held between 1920 and 1939 . Other bodies ( edit ) The League oversaw the Permanent Court of International Justice and several other agencies and commissions created to deal with pressing international problems . These included the Disarmament Commission , the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) , the Mandates Commission , the International Commission on Intellectual Cooperation ( precursor to UNESCO ) , the Permanent Central Opium Board , the Commission for Refugees , and the Slavery Commission . Three of these institutions were transferred to the United Nations after the Second World War : the International Labour Organisation , the Permanent Court of International Justice ( as the International Court of Justice ) , and the Health Organisation ( restructured as the World Health Organization ) . The Permanent Court of International Justice was provided for by the Covenant , but not established by it . The Council and the Assembly established its constitution . Its judges were elected by the Council and the Assembly , and its budget was provided by the latter . The Court was to hear and decide any international dispute which the parties concerned submitted to it . It might also give an advisory opinion on any dispute or question referred to it by the Council or the Assembly . The Court was open to all the nations of the world under certain broad conditions .

This change can be seen in the relationship between the League and non-members . The United States and Russia , for example , increasingly worked with the League . During the second half of the 1920s , France , Britain and Germany were all using the League of Nations as the focus of their diplomatic activity , and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period . They also used the League 's machinery to try to improve relations and settle their differences . Åland islands ( edit ) Main article : Åland crisis Åland is a collection of around 6,500 islands in the Baltic Sea , midway between Sweden and Finland . The islands are almost exclusively Swedish - speaking , but in 1809 , the Åland Islands , along with Finland , were taken by Imperial Russia . In December 1917 , during the turmoil of the Russian October Revolution , Finland declared its independence , but most of the Ålanders wished to rejoin Sweden . The Finnish government considered the islands to be a part of their new nation , as the Russians had included Åland in the Grand Duchy of Finland , formed in 1809 . By 1920 , the dispute had escalated to the point that there was danger of war . The British government referred the problem to the League 's Council , but Finland would not let the League intervene , as they considered it an internal matter . The League created a small panel to decide if it should investigate the matter and , with an affirmative response , a neutral commission was created . In June 1921 , the League announced its decision : the islands were to remain a part of Finland , but with guaranteed protection of the islanders , including demilitarisation . With Sweden 's reluctant agreement , this became the first European international agreement concluded directly through the League . Upper Silesia ( edit ) The Allied powers referred the problem of Upper Silesia to the League after they had been unable to resolve the territorial dispute . After the First World War , Poland laid claim to Upper Silesia , which had been part of Prussia . The Treaty of Versailles had recommended a plebiscite in Upper Silesia to determine whether the territory should become part of Germany or Poland . Complaints about the attitude of the German authorities led to rioting and eventually to the first two Silesian Uprisings ( 1919 and 1920 ) . A plebiscite took place on 20 March 1921 , with 59.6 percent ( around 500,000 ) of the votes cast in favour of joining Germany , but Poland claimed the conditions surrounding it had been unfair . This result led to the Third Silesian Uprising in 1921 .\", 'start': 0, 'stop': 0, 'target': 'NO_ANSWER'}\n","{'example_id': '-4664379689749477533', 'part_id': 59, 'question': 'what treaty set up the league of nations', 'context': \"in January 1923 and seize the port . After the Allies failed to reach an agreement with Lithuania , they referred the matter to the League of Nations . In December 1923 , the League Council appointed a Commission of Inquiry . The commission chose to cede Memel to Lithuania and give the area autonomous rights . The Klaipėda Convention was approved by the League Council on 14 March 1924 , and then by the Allied powers and Lithuania . In 1939 Germany retook the region following the rise of the Nazis and an ultimatum to Lithuania , demanding the return of the region under threat of war . The League of Nations failed to prevent the secession of the Memel region to Germany . Hatay ( edit ) Main article : Hatay State With League oversight , the Sanjak of Alexandretta in the French Mandate of Syria was given autonomy in 1937 . Renamed Hatay , its parliament declared independence as the Republic of Hatay in September 1938 , after elections the previous month . It was annexed by Turkey with French consent in mid-1939 . Mosul ( edit ) Main article : Mosul Question The League resolved a dispute between the Kingdom of Iraq and the Republic of Turkey over control of the former Ottoman province of Mosul in 1926 . According to the British , who had been awarded a League of Nations mandate over Iraq in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs , Mosul belonged to Iraq ; on the other hand , the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic heartland . A League of Nations Commission of Inquiry , with Belgian , Hungarian and Swedish members , was sent to the region in 1924 ; it found that the people of Mosul did not want to be part of either Turkey or Iraq , but if they had to choose , they would pick Iraq . In 1925 , the commission recommended that the region stay part of Iraq , under the condition that the British hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years , to ensure the autonomous rights of the Kurdish population . The League Council adopted the recommendation and decided on 16 December 1925 to award Mosul to Iraq . Although Turkey had accepted League of Nations ' arbitration in the Treaty of Lausanne ( 1923 ) , it rejected the decision , questioning the Council 's authority . The matter was referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice , which ruled that , when the Council made a unanimous decision , it must be accepted . Nonetheless , Britain , Iraq and Turkey ratified a separate treaty on 5 June 1926 that mostly followed the decision of the League Council and also assigned Mosul to Iraq . It was agreed that Iraq could still apply for League membership within 25 years and that\", 'start': 0, 'stop': 0, 'target': 'NO_ANSWER'}\n","{'example_id': '-4664379689749477533', 'part_id': 90, 'question': 'what treaty set up the league of nations', 'context': \"began as a permanent member of the Council , but withdrew in 1939 . The League had accepted Germany , also as a permanent member of the Council , in 1926 , deeming it a `` peace - loving country '' , but Adolf Hitler pulled Germany out when he came to power in 1933 . Collective security ( edit ) Another important weakness grew from the contradiction between the idea of collective security that formed the basis of the League and international relations between individual states . The League 's collective security system required nations to act , if necessary , against states they considered friendly , and in a way that might endanger their national interests , to support states for which they had no normal affinity . This weakness was exposed during the Abyssinia Crisis , when Britain and France had to balance maintaining the security they had attempted to create for themselves in Europe `` to defend against the enemies of internal order '' , in which Italy 's support played a pivotal role , with their obligations to Abyssinia as a member of the League . On 23 June 1936 , in the wake of the collapse of League efforts to restrain Italy 's war against Abyssinia , the British Prime Minister , Stanley Baldwin , told the House of Commons that collective security had failed ultimately because of the reluctance of nearly all the nations in Europe to proceed to what I might call military sanctions ... The real reason , or the main reason , was that we discovered in the process of weeks that there was no country except the aggressor country which was ready for war ... ( I ) f collective action is to be a reality and not merely a thing to be talked about , it means not only that every country is to be ready for war ; but must be ready to go to war at once . That is a terrible thing , but it is an essential part of collective security . Ultimately , Britain and France both abandoned the concept of collective security in favour of appeasement in the face of growing German militarism under Hitler . In this context , the League of Nations was also the institution where the first international debate on terrorism took place following the 1934 assassination of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia in Marseille , showing its conspiratorial features , many of which are detectable in the discourse of terrorism among states after 9 / 11 . American diplomatic historian Samuel Flagg Bemis originally supported the League , but after two decades changed his mind : The League of Nations has been a disappointing failure ... It has been a failure , not because the United States did not join it ; but because the great powers have been unwilling to apply sanctions except where it suited their individual\", 'start': 0, 'stop': 0, 'target': 'NO_ANSWER'}\n","{'example_id': '-4664379689749477533', 'part_id': 168, 'question': 'what treaty set up the league of nations', 'context': 'Southern Rhodesia Soviet Union United Kingdom United States Puerto Rico Yugoslavia Axis and Axis - aligned ( leaders ) Albania Bulgaria Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China Independent State of Croatia Finland Germany Hungary Free India Iraq Italy ( until September 1943 ) Italian Social Republic Japan Manchukuo Philippines ( Second Republic ) Romania Slovakia Thailand Vichy France Armed neutrality Resistance Albania Austria Belgium Bulgaria Czech lands Denmark Estonia Ethiopia France Germany Greece Hong Kong Italy Japan Jewish Korea Latvia Lithuania Luxembourg Malaya Netherlands Northeast China Norway Philippines Poland Anti-communist Romania Thailand Soviet Union Slovakia Western Ukraine Vietnam Yugoslavia Monarchists Timeline Prelude Africa Asia Europe 1939 Poland Phoney War Winter War Atlantic Changsha China 1940 Weserübung Netherlands Belgium France Armistice of 22 June 1940 Britain North Africa West Africa British Somaliland North China Baltic States Moldova Indochina Greece Compass 1941 East Africa Yugoslavia Shanggao Greece Crete Iraq Soviet Union ( Barbarossa ) Finland Lithuania Syria and Lebanon Kiev Iran Leningrad Gorky Moscow Sevastopol Pearl Harbor The outbreak of the Pacific War Hong Kong Philippines Changsha Malaya Borneo ( 1941 -- 42 ) 1942 Burma Changsha Java Sea Coral Sea Gazala Dutch Harbor Attu ( occupation ) Kiska Zhejiang - Jiangxi Midway Rzhev Blue Stalingrad Singapore Dieppe El Alamein Guadalcanal Torch 1943 Tunisia Kursk Smolensk Gorky Solomon Islands Attu Sicily Cottage Lower Dnieper Italy Armistice of Cassibile Gilbert and Marshall Islands Burma Northern Burma and Western Yunnan Changde 1944 Monte Cassino / Shingle Narva Korsun -- Cherkassy Tempest Ichi - Go Overlord ( Battle of Normandy - D - Day ) Neptune Normandy Mariana and Palau Bagration Western Ukraine Tannenberg Line Warsaw Eastern Romania Belgrade Paris Dragoon Gothic Line Market Garden Estonia Crossbow Pointblank Lapland Hungary Leyte Ardennes Bodenplatte Philippines ( 1944 -- 1945 ) Burma ( 1944 -- 45 ) 1945 Vistula -- Oder Iwo Jima Western invasion of Germany Okinawa Italy ( Spring 1945 ) Borneo Syrmian Front Berlin Czechoslovakia Budapest West Hunan Guangxi Surrender of Germany Project Hula Manchuria Manila Borneo Taipei Atomic bombings Debate Kuril Islands Shumshu Surrender of Japan End of World War II in Asia Aspects General Famines Bengal famine of 1943 Chinese famine of 1942 -- 43 Greek Famine of 1941 - 1944 Dutch famine of 1944 -- 45 Vietnamese Famine of 1945 Air warfare of World War II Blitzkrieg Comparative military ranks Cryptography Diplomacy Home front United States Australian United Kingdom Lend - Lease Manhattan Project Military awards Military equipment Military production Nazi plunder Opposition Technology Allied cooperation Total war Strategic bombing Puppet states Women Art and World War II Aftermath Expulsion of Germans Operation Paperclip Operation Osoaviakhim Operation Keelhaul Occupation of Germany Territorial changes of Germany Soviet occupations Romania Poland Hungary Baltic States Occupation of Japan First Indochina War Indonesian National Revolution Cold War Decolonization Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany Popular culture War crimes Allied war crimes Soviet war crimes British war crimes United States war crimes German', 'start': 0, 'stop': 0, 'target': 'NO_ANSWER'}\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":[" 24%|██▍       | 75109/307372 [02:47<07:47, 497.24it/s]"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{'example_id': '-6992942632997814161', 'part_id': 1, 'question': 'who sang tale as old as time beauty and the beast 2017', 'context': \"Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken for the Disney animated feature film Beauty and the Beast ( 1991 ) . The film 's theme song , the Broadway - inspired ballad was first recorded by British - American actress Angela Lansbury in her role as the voice of the character Mrs. Potts , and essentially describes the relationship between its two main characters Belle and the Beast , specifically how the couple has learned to accept their differences and in turn change each other for the better . Additionally , the song 's lyrics imply that the feeling of love is as timeless and ageless as a `` tale as old as time '' . Lansbury 's rendition is heard during the famous ballroom sequence between Belle and the Beast , while a shorted chorale version plays in the closing scenes of the film , and the song 's motif features frequently in other pieces of Menken 's film score . `` Beauty and the Beast '' was subsequently recorded as a pop duet by Canadian singer Celine Dion and American singer Peabo Bryson , and released as the only single from the film 's soundtrack on November 25 , 1991 . Lansbury was initially hesitant to record `` Beauty and the Beast '' because she felt that it was not suitable for her aging singing voice , but ultimately completed the song in one take . In order to promote the film , Disney decided to release `` Beauty and the Beast '' as a single , and first recruited solely Dion to record a radio - friendly version of it . However , the studio was concerned that the then - relatively obscure singer would not attract a large enough audience in the United States on her own , so they hired the more prominent Bryson to be her duet partner . At first Dion was also hesitant to record `` Beauty and the Beast '' because she had just recently been fired from recording the theme song of the animated film An American Tail : Fievel Goes West ( 1991 ) .

In 2004 , the American Film Institute officially recognized `` Beauty and the Beast '' as one of the greatest songs in film history , ranking it 62nd . The song is also featured in the 2017 live - action adaptation ; sung by Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts during the film and also as a duet cover version by Ariana Grande and John Legend during the end credits .

Out of all the songs he has written for Beauty and the Beast , Menken devoted the most time to the title song . The track was first recorded by British - American actress Angela Lansbury , who voices the character Mrs. Potts , an enchanted teapot . The songwriters first introduced `` Beauty and the Beast '' to Lansbury as a demo recording , which was accompanied by a note asking her if she might possibly be interested in singing it . Although a seasoned film and stage performer who had previously done her own singing for Disney in the musical film Bedknobs and Broomsticks ( 1971 ) , Lansbury , who was more accustomed to performing uptempo songs , was hesitant to record the ballad because of its unfamiliar rock style .

'' Angela Lansbury recalled being `` astonished '' when she first saw the `` huge '' and `` unique '' scene . In Moviepilot 's Chris Lucas ' opinion , `` The ballroom scene remains the one that truly symbolizes their adoration for each other . '' IGN believes that the scene `` signals the completion of ( the Beast 's ) inner change - from irascible recluse into ( Belle 's ) true love . '' Music and lyrical interpretation ( edit ) The bridge and verse of the film version , featuring Angela Lansbury . The original film version of `` Beauty and the Beast '' performed by Lansbury was written in the key of G - flat major at a `` moderately slow '' tempo of 84 beats per minute ( Andante ) , at a duration of two minutes and forty - six seconds . An `` eloquent '' rock - influenced pop song with a `` calm '' and `` lilting '' melody , Stephen Whitty of NJ.com described `` Beauty and the Beast '' as a `` Broadway ballad . '' Film critic Roger Ebert described the song 's melody as `` haunting '' , while Entertainment Weekly 's Lisa Schwarzbaum dubbed the song as a `` lullaby '' . The Disney Song Encyclopedia author Thomas S. Hischak described Menken 's melody as `` flowing '' , while BuzzFeed 's Aylin Zafar wrote that the song is `` Tender and warm . '' Writing for the Chicago Tribune , Gene Siskel described Lansbury 's voice , which spans two octaves from B ♭ to E ♭ , as `` richly textured '' . Meanwhile , Michael Cheang of The Star and Bill Gibron of PopMatters wrote that Lansbury performed using a `` fragile '' `` calm , motherly '' tone . Instrumentally , `` Beauty and the Beast '' features several chord changes , woodwinds , and violins . GamesRadar observed that `` Beauty and the Beast '' includes a key change during which `` the music swells , and then the orchestra subsides to leave just trembling violins . '' Describing the ballad as `` soaring '' , TV Guide compared `` Beauty and the Beast '' to `` Shall We Dance ? '' from the musical The King and I . R.L. Shaffer of IGN identified `` Beauty and the Beast '' as a `` tear - jerking poetic ballad . '' Film Genre 2000 : New Critical Essays author Wheeler W. Dixon believes that the song 's lyrics are about the couple 's `` implicit promise of regeneration through love .

In June 1971 , Frank O'Farrell was appointed as manager , but lasted less than 18 months before being replaced by Tommy Docherty in December 1972 . Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season , only to see them relegated in 1974 ; by that time the trio of Best , Law , and Charlton had left the club . The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in 1976 , but were beaten by Southampton . They reached the final again in 1977 , beating Liverpool 2 -- 1 . Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards , following the revelation of his affair with the club physiotherapist 's wife . Dave Sexton replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977 . Despite major signings , including Joe Jordan , Gordon McQueen , Gary Bailey , and Ray Wilkins , the team failed to achieve any significant results ; they finished in the top two in 1979 -- 80 and lost to Arsenal in the 1979 FA Cup Final . Sexton was dismissed in 1981 , even though the team won the last seven games under his direction . He was replaced by Ron Atkinson , who immediately broke the British record transfer fee to sign Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion . Under Atkinson , Manchester United won the FA Cup twice in three years -- in 1983 and 1985 . In 1985 -- 86 , after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches , the club was favourite to win the league , but finished in fourth place . The following season , with the club in danger of relegation by November , Atkinson was dismissed . Ferguson years ( 1986 -- 2013 ) Main article : History of Manchester United F.C. ( 1986 -- 2013 ) Alex Ferguson managed the team between 1986 and 2013 . Alex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on the day of Atkinson 's dismissal , and guided the club to an 11th - place finish in the league . Despite a second - place finish in 1987 -- 88 , the club was back in 11th place the following season . Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed , victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup Final replay ( after a 3 -- 3 draw ) saved Ferguson 's career . The following season , Manchester United claimed its first Cup Winners ' Cup title and competed in the 1991 UEFA Super Cup , beating European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1 -- 0 in the final at Old Trafford .

The attacking style of play adopted by this team ( in contrast to the defensive - minded `` catenaccio '' approach favoured by the leading Italian teams of the era ) `` captured the imagination of the English footballing public '' . Busby 's team also became associated with the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s ; George Best , known as the `` Fifth Beatle '' for his iconic haircut , was the first footballer to significantly develop an off - the - field media profile . As the second English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991 , the club raised significant capital , with which it further developed its commercial strategy . The club 's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses . The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off - the - field media attention to individual players , most notably David Beckham ( who quickly developed his own global brand ) . This attention often generates greater interest in on - the - field activities , and hence generates sponsorship opportunities -- the value of which is driven by television exposure . During his time with the club , Beckham 's popularity across Asia was integral to the club 's commercial success in that part of the world . Because higher league placement results in a greater share of television rights , success on the field generates greater income for the club . Since the inception of the Premier League , Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the BSkyB broadcasting deal . Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club ; in 2005 -- 06 , the club 's commercial arm generated £ 51 million , compared to £ 42.5 million at Chelsea , £ 39.3 million at Liverpool , £ 34 million at Arsenal and £ 27.9 million at Newcastle United . A key sponsorship relationship was with sportswear company Nike , who managed the club 's merchandising operation as part of a £ 303 million 13 - year partnership between 2002 and 2015 . Through Manchester United Finance and the club 's membership scheme , One United , those with an affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services . Additionally , Manchester United - branded media services -- such as the club 's dedicated television channel , MUTV -- have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium .

The modern view of the vice president as a member of the executive branch is due in part to the assignment of executive duties to the vice president by either the president or Congress . Mike Pence of Indiana is the 48th and current vice president . He assumed office on January 20 , 2017 .

Harrison 's vice president , John Tyler , asserted that he had succeeded to the full presidential office , powers , and title , and declined to acknowledge documents referring to him as `` Acting President . '' Despite some strong calls against it , Tyler took the oath of office as the nation 's tenth President . Although some in Congress denounced Tyler 's claim as a violation of the Constitution , it was not challenged legally , and so the Tyler precedent of full succession was established . This was made explicit by Section 1 of the Twenty - fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution , ratified in 1967 . In total , nine Vice Presidents have succeeded to the presidency . In addition to Tyler they are , Millard Fillmore , Andrew Johnson , Chester A. Arthur , Theodore Roosevelt , Calvin Coolidge , Harry S. Truman , Lyndon B. Johnson , and Gerald Ford . Section 2 of the Twenty - fifth Amendment provides for vice presidential succession : Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President , the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress . Gerald Ford was the first vice president selected by this method , after the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew in 1973 ; after succeeding to the presidency , Ford nominated Nelson Rockefeller as vice president . Another issue was who had the power to declare that an incapacitated president is unable to discharge his duties . This question had arisen most recently with the illnesses of President Dwight D. Eisenhower . Sections 3 and 4 of the amendment provide means for the vice president to become acting president upon the temporary disability of the president . Section 3 deals with self - declared incapacity of the president . Section 4 deals with incapacity declared by the joint action of the vice president and of a majority of the Cabinet or of such other body as Congress may by law provide . While Section 4 has never been invoked , Section 3 has been invoked three times : on July 13 , 1985 when Ronald Reagan underwent surgery to remove cancerous polyps from his colon , and twice more on June 29 , 2002 and July 21 , 2007 when George W. Bush underwent colonoscopy procedures requiring sedation . Prior to this amendment , Vice President Richard Nixon informally assumed some of President Dwight Eisenhower 's duties for several weeks on each of three occasions when Eisenhower was ill . Informal roles ( edit ) The extent of any informal roles and functions of the vice president depend on the specific relationship between the president and the vice president , but often include tasks such as drafter\", 'start': 0, 'stop': 0, 'target': 'NO_ANSWER'}\n","{'example_id': '687969463584927575', 'part_id': 50, 'question': 'vice president role as president of the senate', 'context': \"so during the early 1800s . Original election process and Reform ( edit ) Four vice presidents : L-R , outgoing President Lyndon B. Johnson ( the 37th Vice President ) , incoming President Richard Nixon ( 36th ) , ( Everett Dirksen administering oath ) , incoming Vice President Spiro Agnew ( 39th ) , and outgoing Vice President Hubert Humphrey ( 38th ) , January 20 , 1969 Under the original terms of the Constitution , the electors of the Electoral College voted only for office of president rather than for both president and vice president . Each elector was allowed to vote for two people for the top office . The person receiving the greatest number of votes ( provided that such a number was a majority of electors ) would be president , while the individual who received the next largest number of votes became vice president . If no one received a majority of votes , then the House of Representatives would choose among the five candidates with the largest numbers of votes , with each state 's representatives together casting a single vote . In such a case , the person who received the highest number of votes but was not chosen president would become vice president . In the case of a tie for second , then the Senate would choose the vice president . The original plan , however , did not foresee the development of political parties and their adversarial role in the government . For example , in the election of 1796 , Federalist John Adams came in first , but because the Federalist electors had divided their second vote amongst several vice presidential candidates , Democratic - Republican Thomas Jefferson came second . Thus , the president and vice president were from opposing parties . Predictably , Adams and Jefferson clashed over issues such as states ' rights and foreign policy . A greater problem occurred in the election of 1800 , in which the two participating parties each had a secondary candidate they intended to elect as vice president , but the more popular Democratic - Republican party failed to execute that plan with their electoral votes . Under the system in place at the time ( Article II , Section 1 , Clause 3 ) , the electors could not differentiate between their two candidates , so the plan had been for one elector to vote for Thomas Jefferson but not for Aaron Burr , thus putting Burr in second place . This plan broke down for reasons that are disputed , and both candidates received the same number of votes . After 35 deadlocked ballots in the House of Representatives , Jefferson finally won on the 36th ballot and Burr became vice president . This tumultuous affair led to the adoption of the Twelfth Amendment in 1804 , which directed the electors to use separate ballots to vote\", 'start': 0, 'stop': 0, 'target': 'NO_ANSWER'}\n","{'example_id': '687969463584927575', 'part_id': 73, 'question': 'vice president role as president of the senate', 'context': \"vice presidency , the tenure of Dick Cheney saw a rapid growth in the office of the vice president .

High - revving pushrod engines are normally solid ( mechanical ) lifter designs , flat and roller . In 1969 , Chevrolet offered a Corvette and a Camaro model with a solid lifter cam pushrod V8 ( the ZL - 1 ) that could rev to 8,000 rpm . The Volvo B18 and B20 engines can rev to more than 7,000 rpm with their solid lifter camshaft . However , the LS7 of the C6 Corvette Z06 is the first production hydraulic roller cam pushrod engine to have a redline of 7,100 rpm . The Honda CX500 motorcycle engine has a 9650rpm redline , well above the usual limits for auto engines , due to the lighter weight of components . Limited cylinder head design flexibility : overhead camshaft ( OHC ) engines benefit substantially from the ability to use multiple valves per cylinder , as well as much greater freedom of component placement , and intake and exhaust port geometry . Most modern OHV engines have two valves per cylinder , while many OHC engines can have three , four or even five valves per cylinder to achieve greater power . Though multi-valve OHV engines exist , their use is somewhat limited due to their complexity and is mostly restricted to low - and medium - speed diesel engines , with a few notable exceptions such as the four valve per cylinder Honda CX500 motorcycle , and the Harley - Davidson Milwaukee - Eight engine . In OHV engines , the size and shape of the intake ports as well as the position of the valves are limited by the pushrods and the need to accommodate them in the head casting . Spark plug placement is also less ideal in pushrod engines . This is important , since a centrally located spark plug improves combustion efficiency and reduces both emissions and tendency to detonate by reducing flame travel distance ( which also reduces combustion time ) . DOHC engines with four valves per cylinder can have a truly centrally located spark plug because this space is free from both valves in the combustion chamber and valvetrain above this central area . Even SOHC engines with four valves per cylinder can usually accommodate a central spark plug . But since pushrod engines almost always have only two valves per cylinder , it is impossible to have a central spark plug . Noise and refinement : OHV engines are generally noisier than their OHC counterparts owing to the increased complexity of the valvetrain and the adoption of chain or gear based camshaft drive . Maintenance : The location of the camshaft in the cylinder block often necessitates removal of the engine whenever camshaft work is required .

Georg needed a mother for his children , and Maria needed the security of a husband and family once she decided to leave the abbey . `` I really and truly was not in love , '' Maria wrote in her memoir , `` I liked him but did n't love him . However , I loved the children , so in a way I really married the children . I learned to love him more than I have ever loved before or after . '' They were married in 1927 , not in 1938 as depicted in the film , and the couple had been married for over a decade by the time of the Anschluss and had two of their three children together by that time . Maria later acknowledged that she grew to love Georg over time and enjoyed a happy marriage . The von Trapp family lost most of its wealth during the worldwide depression of the early 1930s , when the Austrian national bank folded . In order to survive , the family dismissed the servants and began taking in boarders . They also started singing onstage to earn money -- a fact that caused the proud Georg much embarrassment . In the film , the von Trapp family hike over the Alps from Austria to Switzerland to escape the Nazis , which would not have been possible ; Salzburg is over two hundred miles from Switzerland . The von Trapp villa , however , was only a few kilometers from the Austria -- Germany border , and the final scene shows the family hiking on the Obersalzberg near the German town of Berchtesgaden , within sight of Adolf Hitler 's Kehlsteinhaus Eagle 's Nest retreat . In reality , the family simply walked to the local train station and boarded a train to Italy . Although Georg was an ethnic German - Austrian , he was also an Italian citizen , having been born in the Dalmatian city of Zadar , which at that time was part of the Austro - Hungarian Empire , and later fell into Italian territory after World War I.

All spellers who did not qualify for Round Seven tie for the same place . Regulations of oral rounds ( edit ) Before 2004 , a speller could not be required to spell a given word until the judges deemed that the word had been clearly pronounced and identified by the speller ; even then , judges rarely if ever instructed a contestant to begin spelling unless it was obvious that the speller was making no further progress in figuring out the word and that he / she was instead simply `` stalling for time '' . Most local and regional competitions continue to follow this rule and enforcement pattern , although they are not obliged to do so . Starting in 2004 , the Bee adopted new rules . A speller is given two and a half minutes from when a word is first pronounced to spell it completely . The first two minutes are Regular Time ; the final thirty seconds are Finish Time . During this time limit , a speller is allowed to ask the pronouncer for the word 's : Definition Part of speech Use in a sentence Language ( s ) of origin ( the complete etymology of the word is not provided ) Alternate pronunciations Root ( A speller may ask whether a word comes from a particular root word or word element , but the competitor must specify that root 's language of origin and definition . ) A chime signals that regular time has expired , and the judges inform the speller that Finish Time has begun . The speller may watch a clock counting down from thirty seconds ; no timing devices are allowed onstage . During Finish Time , a speller may not make further requests to the pronouncer but rather must begin spelling the word . Any speller who exceeds the time limit is automatically eliminated ; judges do not acknowledge letters spelled after the end of Finish Time . A speller is allowed to stop spelling a word and restart spelling , but if ( s ) he changes the letters already said , the alteration counts as a misspelling and causes automatic elimination . Starting in the 2015 bee , the time limit was reduced to two minutes , indicated by a monitor with a traffic light on it . For the first 75 seconds , the traffic light is green . Once 45 seconds remain , the light turns yellow and a countdown appears on the screen .

A cease fire was eventually reached with the signature of the Arusha Memorandum in October 1967 , but relative insecurity prevailed through 1969 . To discourage further invasions , Kenya signed a defence pact with Ethiopia in 1969 , which is still in effect . On 12 December 1964 the Republic of Kenya was proclaimed , and Jomo Kenyatta became Kenya 's first president . Moi era ( 1978 -- 2002 ) At Kenyatta 's death in 1978 , Daniel arap Moi became President . Daniel arap Moi retained the Presidency , being unopposed in elections held in 1979 , 1983 ( snap elections ) and 1988 , all of which were held under the single party constitution . The 1983 elections were held a year early , and were a direct result of an abortive military coup attempt on 2 August 1982 . Daniel arap Moi , Kenya 's second President , and George W.

Diseases of poverty directly correlate with a country 's economic performance and wealth distribution : Half of Kenyans live below the poverty level . Preventable diseases like malaria , HIV / AIDS , pneumonia , diarrhoea and malnutrition are the biggest burden , major child - killers , and responsible for much morbidity ; weak policies , corruption , inadequate health workers , weak management and poor leadership in the public health sector are largely to blame . According to 2009 estimates , HIV prevalence is about 6.3 % of the adult population . However , the 2011 UNAIDS Report suggests that the HIV epidemic may be improving in Kenya , as HIV prevalence is declining among young people ( ages 15 -- 24 ) and pregnant women . Kenya had an estimated 15 million cases of malaria in 2006 . Women Main article : Women in Kenya Kenyan women in Nairobi The total fertility rate in Kenya is estimated to be 4.49 children per woman in 2012 . According to a 2008 -- 09 survey by the Kenyan government , the total fertility rate was 4.6 % and the contraception usage rate among married women was 46 % . Maternal mortality is high , partly because of female genital mutilation , with about 27 % of women having undergone it . This practice is however on the decline as the country becomes more modernised , and the practice was also banned in the country in 2011 . Women were economically empowered before colonialization . By colonial land alienation , women lost access and control of land . They became more economically dependent on men . A colonial order of gender emerged where the male dominated the female . Median age at first marriage increases with increasing education . Rape , defilement and battering are not always seen as serious crimes . Reports of sexual assault are not always taken seriously . Education Main article : Education in Kenya School children in a classroom . An MSc student at Kenyatta University in Nairobi . Children attend nursery school , or kindergarten in the private sector until they are five years old . This lasts one to three years ( KG1 , KG2 and KG3 ) and is financed privately because there has been no government policy regarding it until recently . Basic formal education starts at age six years and lasts 12 years consisting of eight years in primary school and four years in high school or secondary school . Primary school is free in public schools and those attending can join a vocational youth / village polytechnic or make their own arrangements for an apprenticeship program and learn a trade such as tailoring , carpentry , motor vehicle repair , brick - laying and masonry for about two years .

The higher diploma is accepted by many employers in place of a bachelor 's degree and direct or accelerated admission to post-graduate studies is possible in some universities . A Maasai girl at school . Public universities in Kenya are highly commercialized institutions and only a small fraction of qualified high school graduates are admitted on limited government - sponsorship into programs of their choice . Most are admitted into the social sciences , which are cheap to run , or as self - sponsored students paying the full cost of their studies . Most qualified students who miss out opt for middle - level diploma programs in public or private universities , colleges , and polytechnics . 38.5 percent of the Kenyan adult population is illiterate . There are very wide regional disparities ; for example , Nairobi had the highest level of literacy , 87.1 per cent , compared to North Eastern Province , the lowest , at 8.0 per cent . Preschool , which targets children from age three to five , is an integral component of the education system and is a key requirement for admission to Standard One ( First Grade ) . At the end of primary education , pupils sit the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education ( KCPE ) , which determines those who proceed to secondary school or vocational training . The result of this examination is needed for placement at secondary school . Primary school is for students aged 6 / 7 - 13 / 14 years . For those who proceed to the secondary level , there is a national examination at the end of Form Four -- the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education ( KCSE ) , which determines those proceeding to the universities , other professional training or employment . Students sit examinations in eight subjects of their choosing . However , English , Kiswahili and mathematics are compulsory subjects . The Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service ( KUCCPS ) , formerly the Joint Admissions Board ( JAB ) , is responsible for selecting students joining the public universities . Other than the public schools , there are many private schools , mainly in urban areas . Similarly , there are a number of international schools catering to various overseas educational systems . Despite its impressive commercial approach and interests in the country , Kenya 's academia and higher education system is notoriously rigid and disconnected from the needs of the local labour market and is widely blamed for the high number of unemployable and `` half - baked '' university graduates who struggle to fit in the modern workplace .

For other uses , see Moor . Castillian ambassadors attempting to convince Moorish Almohad king Abu Hafs Umar al - Murtada to join their alliance ( contemporary depiction from the Cantigas de Santa María ) The term `` Moors '' refers primarily to the Muslim inhabitants of the Maghreb , the Iberian Peninsula , Sicily , and Malta during the Middle Ages . The Moors initially were the Berber autochthones of the Maghreb . The name was later also applied to Arabs . Moors are not a distinct or self - defined people , and the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica observed that `` The term ' Moors ' has no real ethnological value . '' Medieval and early modern Europeans variously applied the name to Arabs , North African Berbers , and Muslim Europeans . The term has also been used in Europe in a broader , somewhat derogatory sense to refer to Muslims in general , especially those of Arab or Berber descent , whether living in Spain or North Africa . During the colonial era , the Portuguese introduced the names `` Ceylon Moors '' and `` Indian Moors '' in Sri Lanka , and the Bengali Muslims were also called Moors . In 711 , troops mostly formed by Moors from North Africa led the Umayyad conquest of Hispania . The Iberian peninsula then came to be known in classical Arabic as Al - Andalus , which at its peak included most of Septimania and modern - day Spain and Portugal . In 827 , the Moors occupied Mazara on Sicily , developing it as a port . They eventually consolidated the rest of the island and some of southern Italy . Differences in religion and culture led to a centuries - long conflict with the Christian kingdoms of Europe , which tried to reclaim control of Muslim areas ; this conflict was referred to as the Reconquista . In 1224 the Muslims were expelled from Sicily to the settlement of Lucera , which was destroyed by European Christians in 1300 . The fall of Granada in 1492 marked the end of Muslim rule in Iberia , although a Muslim minority persisted until their expulsion in 1609 .

These guitars , known as ES - 150s ( Electric Spanish Series ) were the first manufactured semi-acoustic guitars . Gibson based them on a standard production archtop , with f holes on the face of the guitar 's soundbox . This model resembled traditional jazz guitars that were popular at the time . The soundbox on the guitar let limited sound emit from the hollow body of the guitar . These guitars , however , could be electrically amplified via a Charlie Christian pickup , a magnetic single - coil pickup that converted the energy of the vibrating strings into an electrical signal . The clear sound of the pickups made the ES series immediately popular with jazz musicians . The first semi-acoustic guitars are often thought of as an evolutionary step in the progression from acoustic guitars to full electric models . However , Gibson made the ES - 150 several years after Rickenbacker made the first solid - body electric guitar . The ES series was merely an experiment the Gibson company used to test the potential success of electric guitars . The experiment was a successful financial venture , and the ES series is often referred to as the first successful electric guitar . The ES - 150 was followed by the ES - 250 a year later , in what became a long line of semi acoustics for the Gibson company . In 1949 Gibson released two new models : the ES - 175 and ES - 5 . These guitars came standard with built - in electric pickups and are widely considered the first fully electric semi-acoustic guitars . Prior models were not built with pickups ; rather , they came as attachments . As the production and popularity of solid body electric guitars increased , there was still a market of guitar players who wanted to have the traditional look associated with the semi-acoustic guitars of the 1930s but also wanted the versatility and comfort of new solid body guitars . Several models , including the ES - 350T by Gibson , were made in the 1950s to accommodate this growing demand by including a more comfortable version of the archtop model . Gibson and other makers followed these variations with an entirely new type of guitar that featured a block of solid wood between the front and back sections of the guitars cutaway . This guitar still functioned acoustically , but had a smaller resonant cavity inside , which makes less sound emit from the f holes . Gibson first manufactured this variant in 1958 . It is commonly referred to as a semi-hollow body guitar , because of the smaller , less open body . Rickenbacker also began making semi-acoustic guitars in 1958 .

As new models came out with sleeker designs , the guitars began to make their way into popular circles . The guitar became used in pop , folk , and blues . The guitars sometimes produced feedback when played through an amplifier at a loud level . This made the guitars unpopular for bands that had to play loud enough to perform in large venues . As rock became more experimental in the late 60s and 70s , the guitar became more popular because players learned to use its feedback issues creatively . Semi-hollow guitars share some of the tonal characteristics of hollow guitars , such as their praised warmth and clean tone .

Some manufacturers have tried other variations to the telescopic fork . For example , Cannondale designed a shock absorber build into the steerer tube called HeadShok , and a single - sided fork with just one leg , called Lefty . The stanchions of both systems are not round but have flat faces machined onto them which slide on needle bearings instead of bushings , this prevents the wheel from rotating in relation to the handlebars . Both of these systems claim to offer greater rigidity and better feel , with lighter weight . Others such as Proflex ( Girvin ) , Whyte and BMW , have made suspension forks that employ four - bar linkage systems instead of relying upon telescopic fork legs , much like BMW 's Duolever .

Horst Leitner began working on the problem of chain torque and its effect on suspension in the mid-1970s with motorcycles . In 1985 Leitner built a prototype mountain bike incorporating what became known later as the `` Horst link '' . The Horst Link is a type of four - bar suspension . Leitner formed a mountain bike and research company , AMP research , that began building full - suspension mountain bikes .

The 48 - star flag was in effect for 47 years until the 49 - star version became official on July 4 , 1959 . The 50 - star flag was ordered by the then president Eisenhower on August 21 , 1959 , and was adopted in July 1960 .

In this letter , he asked for a `` Quarter Cask of the Public Wine '' as payment for designing the U.S. flag , the seal for the Admiralty Board , the seal for the Treasury Board , Continental currency , the Great Seal of the United States , and other devices . However , in three subsequent bills to Congress , Hopkinson asked to be paid in cash , but he did not list his U.S. flag design . Instead , he asked to be paid for designing the `` great Naval Flag of the United States '' in the first bill ; the `` Naval Flag of the United States '' in the second bill ; and `` the Naval Flag of the States '' in the third , along with the other items . The flag references were generic terms for the naval ensign that Hopkinson had designed , that is , a flag of seven red stripes and six white ones . The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea . By contrast , Hopkinson 's flag for the United States had seven white stripes , and six red ones -- in reality , six red stripes laid on a white background . Hopkinson 's sketches have not been found , but we can make these conclusions because Hopkinson incorporated different stripe arrangements in the Admiralty ( naval ) Seal that he designed in the Spring of 1780 and the Great Seal of the United States that he proposed at the same time . His Admiralty Seal had seven red stripes ; whereas , his second U.S. Seal proposal had seven white ones . Hopkinson 's flag for the Navy is the one that the Nation preferred as the national flag . Remnants of Hopkinson 's U.S. flag of seven white stripes can be found in the Great Seal of the United States and the President 's seal . When Hopkinson was chairman of the Navy Board , his position was like that of today 's Secretary of the Navy . The payment was not made , however , because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress . This contradicts the legend of the Betsy Ross flag , which suggests that she sewed the first Stars and Stripes flag by request of the government in the Spring of 1776 . Furthermore , a letter from the War Board to George Washington on May 10 , 1779 , documents that there was still no design established for a national flag for the Army 's use in battle .

The apocryphal story credits Betsy Ross for sewing the first flag from a pencil sketch handed to her by George Washington . No evidence for this exists either in the diaries of George Washington nor in the records of the Continental Congress . Indeed , nearly a century passed before Ross ' grandson , William Canby , first publicly suggested the story in 1870 . By her family 's own admission , Ross ran an upholstery business , and she had never made a flag as of the supposed visit in June 1776 . Furthermore , her grandson admitted that his own search through the Journals of Congress and other official records failed to find corroboration of his grandmother 's story . The family of Rebecca Young claimed that she sewed the first flag . Young 's daughter was Mary Pickersgill , who made the Star Spangled Banner Flag . According to rumor , the Washington family coat of arms , shown in a 15th - century window of Selby Abbey , was the origin of the stars and stripes .

The current U.S. flag is the longest - used flag , having surpassed the 1912 version in 2007 .

Although the theme is ageing , it was one of the first songs McCartney wrote , when he was 16 . It was in the Beatles ' setlist in their early days as a song to perform when their amplifiers broke down or the electricity went off . Both George Martin and Mark Lewisohn speculated that McCartney may have thought of the song when recording began for Sgt . Pepper in December 1966 because his father turned 64 earlier that year . Lennon said of the song , `` Paul wrote it in the Cavern days . We just stuck a few more words on it like ' grandchildren on your knee ' and ' Vera , Chuck and Dave ' ... this was just one that was quite a hit with us . '' . Instrumentation ( edit ) A clarinet trio ( two B ♭ clarinets and a bass clarinet ) is featured prominently in the song . Scored by Martin , he said they were added at McCartney 's request to `` get around the lurking schmaltz factor '' by using the clarinets `` in a classical way . '' In the song 's final verse , the clarinet is played in harmony with McCartney 's vocal . Supporting instruments include the piano , bass , drum set , tubular bells , and electric guitar . Recording ( edit ) The song was recorded on 6 December 1966 , during one of the first sessions for the as - yet - unnamed album that became Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band .

They changed the lyrics to fit the occasion with the help of Giles Martin . At the time , by unfortunate coincidence , McCartney was recently separated from his second wife , Heather Mills ; they later divorced . In the 2007 comedy film Walk Hard : The Dewey Cox Story , McCartney ( played by Jack Black ) and Lennon ( played by Paul Rudd ) are arguing , and Lennon quips , `` I wonder if your songs will still be shit when I 'm sixty - four .

In 2009 , Mr. Justice Davis ruled at the High Court that Entwistle could be considered for release after 25 years ( less 10 months spent on remand ) if he was judged to no longer be a threat to the public , rather than imposing a whole life tariff , saying that `` He can only be released if ever ( and it may be never ) he is assessed as no longer a danger to the public . '' The parole board turned down his request for release in June 2013 . Victor Miller 1988 - A predator who abducted , sexually assaulted and battered to death a 14 - year - old boy from Hagley in Worcestershire in February 1988 . He confessed after being arrested for an unrelated crime soon afterwards and led detectives to the body . Police later revealed they believed Miller was responsible for almost 30 unsolved sexual assaults . In court later that year , he confessed openly to the killing and asked for the maximum sentence available . Although he was set a tariff of 25 years which was reactivated after the November 2002 law lords ' ruling , meaning he could be considered for release in 2013 . Since his trial , Miller has asked that the appropriate authorities should not consider him for release at any point in the future , and therefore actively wishes to die in prison . Miller 's trial judge had also expressed doubt as to whether it would ever be safe to release him . John Duffy Railway Killer 1988 - The Railway Killer , who attacked numerous women in the south of England , raping all of them and murdering three , before revolutionary psychological profiling helped police to catch him , although they got no nearer the accomplice they knew Duffy worked with . He was given a 30 - year tariff for two murders and seven rapes which , after the law lords ' ruling , was reactivated , meaning that he could be considered for release in 2018 .

He also revealed his part in countless other rapes , for which he received a further 12 years . After Duffy gave evidence against him , Mulcahy was jailed for life for three murders and seven rapes in 2001 but is not believed to be among the prisoners who have been issued with a whole life tariff .

Jamie Reynolds 2013 Pleaded guilty to murdering 17 - year - old Georgia Williams after luring her to his home in Wellington , Shropshire , in May 2013 . He then dumped her body near Wrexham , North Wales , where it was found just after his arrest in Glasgow several days later . In 2008 Reynolds tried to strangle a girl , but this merely resulted in a final warning when police investigated . In 2011 , Reynolds drove his car into that of a girl who had rejected his advances , but police did not connect this with the 2008 incident . The Justice Liaison Service and police were told about violent pornography Reynolds had viewed , as well as images he had created of young women and teenage girls he personally knew . This was also not taken sufficiently seriously and the girls were not warned . Several agencies were involved with Reynolds but there was no co-ordinated approach to managing or monitoring him , and consequently few people who knew him were aware of these incidents . In the aftermath of his conviction for the murder of Georgia Williams , media sources stated that the murder could have been prevented if police and social services had acted on information they had received about Reynolds , which would have led to him being monitored and registered as a sex offender when at liberty , even if he had not been jailed for these offences . Reynolds , 23 at the time his trial began and still 22 when he murdered Williams , confessed to the murder on 2 December 2013 . Sentencing was delayed until 19 December , when the judge sentenced him to life imprisonment and recommended that he should never be released , after reading reports from psychiatrists stating that Reynolds had the potential to progress into a serial killer if not apprehended and was likely to remain a danger to women for the rest of his life . The court also heard of pornographic material found on his computer , including 72 graphic videos and more than 16,000 graphic images . A murderer at the age of 22 and sentenced to life at 23 , Reynolds is one of the youngest people in British history to be handed a whole - life tariff . In April 2014 it was reported that he would be appealing for a reduction in his sentence , despite his solicitor announcing shortly after the trial that Reynolds was resigned to spending the rest of his life in prison and would not be challenging his sentence . His appeal was rejected on 31 October 2014 . Since he was remanded in custody during 2013 , Reynolds has been held at Ashworth Hospital , Merseyside .

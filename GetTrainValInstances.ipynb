The path of totality touched 14 states , and the rest of the U.S. had a partial eclipse .

Michael Zeiler , an eclipse cartographer , had estimated that between 1.85 million and 7.4 million people would travel to the path of the eclipse . </P> <P> In Oregon , an estimated one million people were expected to arrive that the Oregon National Guard was called in to help manage traffic in Madras along US 26 and US 97 . Madras Municipal Airport received more than 400 mostly personal planes that queued for hours while waiting to leave after the eclipse . </P> <P> Officials in Idaho , where the totality path crossed the center of the state , began planning for the eclipse a year in advance .

The ISP tweeted a picture of bumper - to - bumper traffic stalled on the interstate just south of Idaho Falls . Motorists reported to local news outlets that it was taking them two hours to travel the 47 miles ( 76 km ) from that city to Pocatello to the south , a journey that normally takes 45 minutes .

After more negotiation and compromise , the delegates finally approved of the proposal to create the League of Nations ( French : Société des Nations , German : Völkerbund ) on 25 January 1919 .

Most of these questions were handled by the victorious Allied powers in bodies such as the Allied Supreme Council . The Allies tended to refer only particularly difficult matters to the League . This meant that , during the early interwar period , the League played little part in resolving the turmoil resulting from the war . The questions the League considered in its early years included those designated by the Paris Peace treaties . </P> <P> As the League developed , its role expanded , and by the middle of the 1920s it had become the centre of international activity .

During the second half of the 1920s , France , Britain and Germany were all using the League of Nations as the focus of their diplomatic activity , and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period .

In December 1917 , during the turmoil of the Russian October Revolution , Finland declared its independence , but most of the Ålanders wished to rejoin Sweden . The Finnish government considered the islands to be a part of their new nation , as the Russians had included Åland in the Grand Duchy of Finland , formed in 1809 . By 1920 , the dispute had escalated to the point that there was danger of war . The British government referred the problem to the League 's Council , but Finland would not let the League intervene , as they considered it an internal matter . The League created a small panel to decide if it should investigate the matter and , with an affirmative response , a neutral commission was created . In June 1921 , the League announced its decision : the islands were to remain a part of Finland , but with guaranteed protection of the islanders , including demilitarisation .

At first Dion was also hesitant to record `` Beauty and the Beast '' because she had just recently been fired from recording the theme song of the animated film An American Tail : Fievel Goes West ( 1991 ) . First heard during the film 's end credits , the single was produced by Walter Afanasieff who also arranged it with Robbie Buchanan , and included on Dion 's self - titled album . The single was accompanied by a music video . Directed by Dominic Orlando , it combined footage of the singers recording the song at The Power Station with excerpts from the film . </P> <P> Both versions of `` Beauty and the Beast '' were very successful , garnering both a Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Original Song , as well as Grammy Awards for Best Song Written for Visual Media and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals . The single was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and the Grammy Award for Song of the Year . Lansbury 's performance has been universally lauded by both film and music critics . While the Dion - Bryson version received mixed reviews from critics who felt that it was inferior to Lansbury 's original , the single became a commercial success , peaking at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming the better - known of the two renditions . In addition to returning Disney songs to the pop charts after a thirty - year absence , the success of `` Beauty and the Beast '' also launched Dion 's career and established her as a bankable recording artist . After `` Beauty and the Beast '' became the first Disney song to undergo a complete pop transformation , several contemporary artists were inspired to release their own radio - friendly renditions of Disney songs throughout the decade . Considered to be among Disney 's best and most popular songs , `` Beauty and the Beast '' has since been covered by numerous artists . In 2004 , the American Film Institute officially recognized `` Beauty and the Beast '' as one of the greatest songs in film history , ranking it 62nd . </P> <P> The song is also featured in the 2017 live - action adaptation ; sung by Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts during the film and also as a duet cover version by Ariana Grande and John Legend during the end credits .

Main article : Electoral College ( United States ) <P> Vice presidents are elected indirectly in the United States . A number of electors , collectively known as the Electoral College , officially select the president and vice president . On Election Day , voters in each of the states and the District of Columbia cast ballots for these electors . Each state is allocated a number of electors , equal to the size of its delegation in both Houses of Congress combined .

The Trapp Family was released in West Germany on October 9 , 1956 and became a major success . Two years later , Liebeneiner directed a sequel , The Trapp Family in America , and the two pictures became the most successful films in West Germany during the post-war years . Their popularity extended throughout Europe and South America . </P> <P> In 1956 , Paramount Pictures purchased the United States film rights , intending to produce an English - language version with Audrey Hepburn as Maria . The studio eventually dropped its option , but one of its directors , Vincent J. Donehue , proposed the story as a stage musical for Mary Martin . Producers Richard Halliday and Leland Heyward secured the rights and hired playwrights Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse , who had won the Pulitzer Prize for State of the Union . They approached Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II to compose one song for the musical , but the composers felt the two styles -- traditional Austrian folk songs and their composition -- would not work together . They offered to write a complete new score for the entire production if the producers were willing to wait while they completed work on Flower Drum Song . The producers quickly responded that they would wait as long as necessary . The Sound of Music stage musical opened on November 16 , 1959 at the Lunt - Fontanne Theatre in New York City and ran on Broadway for 1,443 performances , winning six Tony Awards , including Best Musical . In June 1960 , Twentieth Century Fox purchased the film adaptation rights to the stage musical for $1.25 million ( equivalent to $10,300,000 in 2017 ) against ten percent of the gross . </P> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <P> For the film , Richard Rodgers added two new songs , `` I Have Confidence '' and `` Something Good '' , for which he wrote the lyrics as well as the music ( Hammerstein having died in August 1960 ) , while three of the original stage songs were omitted , `` How Can Love Survive '' , `` No Way To Stop It '' and `` An Ordinary Couple '' . Arranger and conductor Irwin Kostal prerecorded the songs with a large orchestra and singers on a stage prior to the start of filming , and later adapted instrumental underscore passages based on the songs . Choreographers Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood , who had worked with Andrews on Mary Poppins , worked out all new choreography sequences that incorporated many of the Salzburg locations and settings .

Charmian Carr refuted the claim that the voices of the child actors were dubbed in the film and on the soundtrack . Carr contended that all of the children who are in the film sing on the track , but four other children were added to most of the songs to give them a fuller sound , they did not replace them as singers .

This led makers to try a series of designs that focused on amplifying a guitar electrically through a loudspeaker . In 1936 , Gibson made their first production run of electric guitars . These guitars , known as ES - 150s ( Electric Spanish Series ) were the first manufactured semi-acoustic guitars . </P> <P> Gibson based them on a standard production archtop , with f holes on the face of the guitar 's soundbox . This model resembled traditional jazz guitars that were popular at the time . The soundbox on the guitar let limited sound emit from the hollow body of the guitar . These guitars , however , could be electrically amplified via a Charlie Christian pickup , a magnetic single - coil pickup that converted the energy of the vibrating strings into an electrical signal . The clear sound of the pickups made the ES series immediately popular with jazz musicians . The first semi-acoustic guitars are often thought of as an evolutionary step in the progression from acoustic guitars to full electric models . </P> <P> However , Gibson made the ES - 150 several years after Rickenbacker made the first solid - body electric guitar . The ES series was merely an experiment the Gibson company used to test the potential success of electric guitars . The experiment was a successful financial venture , and the ES series is often referred to as the first successful electric guitar . The ES - 150 was followed by the ES - 250 a year later , in what became a long line of semi acoustics for the Gibson company . </P> <P> In 1949 Gibson released two new models : the ES - 175 and ES - 5 .

When the company changed ownership in 1954 , they hired German guitar crafter , Roger Rossmiesl . He developed the 300 series for Rickenbacker , which was a wide semi-acoustic that did not use a traditional f hole . Rather it used a sleeker dash hole on one side of the guitar , the other side had a large pickguard . This model boasted a modern design with a unique Fireglo finish . It quickly became one of Rickenbacker 's most popular series and became a strong competitor to Gibson 's models . </P> <P> In addition to the main model variants of the guitar , Gibson made several small changes to the guitar , including a laminated top for the ES - 175 model and mounted top pickups for general use on all their models , as opposed to Charlie Christian models from the 1930s . While Gibson provided many of the innovations in semi-acoustic guitars from the 1930s to the 1950s , there were also various makes by other companies including a hollow archtop by Gretsch . The 6120 model by Gretsch became very popular as a rockabilly model despite having almost no technical differences from Gibson models . Rickenbacker was also a prominent maker of the semi-hollow body guitar . Gibson , Gretsch , Rickenbacker , and other companies still make semi-acoustic and semi-hollow body guitars , making slight variations on their yearly designs .\", 'start': 205, 'stop': 213, 'target': 'SHORT'}\n"

Some water and grit may find its way in through these holes , staying trapped inside and accumulating over time .

More aggressive suspension frames and forks made for downhill racing and freeriding have as much as 8 or 9 inches ( 200 or 230 mm ) of suspension travel . </P> <P> Many riders still prefer to ride a hardtail frame , and almost all mountain bicycle riders use a suspension fork . Notable suspension fork manufacturers include Marzocchi , Fox Racing Shox , RockShox , and ( to a lesser extent ) X-Fusion , RST , Suntour and Magura . Some bicycle manufacturers ( notably Cannondale and Specialized ) also make their own suspension systems to fully complement and integrate the bike set - up . </P> <H2> Road bikes ( edit ) </H2> <P> Although much less common , some road bicycles do incorporate suspensions , particularly the Soft Tail variety mentioned above . One example is Trek Bicycle Corporation 's s.p.a ( Suspension Performance Advantage ) rear suspension , offered on some of their Pilot models , but the system was removed for the 2008 model year . Virtually all bicycles produced by Alex Moulton bicycles also have very effective full suspension , due to the low unsuspended mass of the small wheels and high pressure tires , a characteristic of the unconventional design of these bicycles . A recent design is the cantilevered ' swing shock ' on some modern hybrid bikes . </P> <H2> Recumbent bikes ( edit ) </H2> The Optima Stinger recumbent with rear suspension <P> Many recumbent bicycles have at least a rear suspension because the rider is usually unable to lift themselves off the seat while riding . Single pivot is usually adequate when the pedaling thrust is horizontal - that is , forwards rather than downwards . This is usually the case provided the bottom bracket is higher than the seat 's base\", 'start': 0, 'stop': 0, 'target': 'NO_ANSWER'}\n"

The sixth film produced in the Planet of the Apes franchise , it was loosely adapted from Pierre Boulle \\'s 1963 novel of the same name and the 1968 film version . It tells the story of astronaut Leo Davidson crash - landing on a planet inhabited by intelligent apes . The apes treat humans as slaves , but with the help of an ape named Ari , Leo starts a rebellion . </P> <P> Development for a Planet of the Apes remake started as far back as 1988 with Adam Rifkin . His project nearly reached the pre-production stage before being canceled . Terry Hayes \\'s script , titled Return of the Apes , would have starred Arnold Schwarzenegger , under the direction of Phillip Noyce . Oliver Stone , Don Murphy , and Jane Hamsher were set to produce . Creative differences ensued between Hayes and financier / distributor 20th Century Fox .

Mrs. Pinchwife was Elizabeth Boutell or Bowtel , a young actress who had `` a childish look . Her voice was weak , tho ' very mellow ; she generally acted the young innocent lady whom all the heroes are mad in love with '' . Boutell 's previous recorded roles had in fact all been unmarried as well as innocent girls , and Margery was her first married role . Matching Boutell and Mohun as a couple would emphasise `` her youth and innocence against Mohun 's age and violence '' . The other husband to be cuckolded by Horner , Sir Jaspar Fidget , was played by another elderly actor , William Cartwright , best known for comic parts such as Falstaff . This casting suggests that Sir Jaspar was played as a straightforwardly comic part , while Pinchwife would be `` alarming as well as funny '' . </P> <P> The male leads Horner and Harcourt were played by the contrasted actors Charles Hart and Edward Kynaston ( or Kenaston ) . The forcefully masculine 45 - year - old Hart `` was celebrated for superman roles , notably the arrogant , bloodthirsty Almanzor in John Dryden 's Conquest of Granada '' , and also for playing rakish comedy heroes with nonchalance and charisma . Many critics credit the personalities and skills of Hart and Nell Gwyn with creating , as much as any playwright did , the famous flirting / bantering Restoration comedy couple . The beautiful androgynous Kynaston , probably in his early thirties , was a different kind of hero . He had started his career in 1660 as the outstanding Restoration female impersonator -- `` the prettiest woman in the whole house '' -- before real women entered the profession in the fall of 1660 . ( The 2004 movie Stage Beauty is loosely based on Kynaston 's career . ) </P> <P> John Harold Wilson argues that the famously virile stage presence of Hart as Horner must be taken into account when interpreting the play . As personified by Hart , Horner will have won women not so much through clever trickery as `` the old - fashioned way '' , by being `` dangerously attractive '' , and it is only fools like Sir Jaspar Fidget who really believe him harmless . Harcourt / Kynaston , although by 1675 a well - regarded and skilful actor of male roles , would clearly have been overshadowed by Horner / Hart . The actresses associated with each hero must also have tended to make the Horner plot more striking on the stage than the true - love plot .

The marble pyramidion has thin walls only 7 inches ( 18 cm ) thick supported by six arches , two between opposite walls that cross at the center of the pyramidion and four smaller corner arches . The top of the pyramidion is a large marble capstone with a small aluminum pyramid at its apex with inscriptions on all four sides . The lowest 150 feet ( 45.7 m ) of the walls , constructed during the first phase 1848 -- 54 , are composed of a pile of bluestone gneiss rubble stones ( not finished stones ) held together by a large amount of mortar with a facade of semi-finished marble stones about 1 ⁄ feet ( 0.4 m ) thick .

The stairs contain fifty sections , most on the north and south walls , with many long landings stretching between them along the east and west walls . These landings allowed many inscribed memorial stones of various materials and sizes to be easily viewed while the stairs were accessible ( until 1976 ) plus one memorial stone between stairs that is difficult to view . The pyramidion has eight observation windows , two per side , and eight red aircraft warning lights , two per side . Two aluminum lightning rods connected via the elevator support columns to ground water protect the monument . The monument 's present foundation is 37 feet ( 11.3 m ) thick , consisting of half of its original bluestone gneiss rubble encased in concrete . At the northeast corner of the foundation , 21 feet ( 6.4 m ) below ground , is the marble cornerstone , including a zinc case filled with memorabilia .

It is the main feature of Crater Lake National Park and is famous for its deep blue color and water clarity . The lake partly fills a nearly 2,148 - foot ( 655 m ) - deep caldera that was formed around 7,700 ( ± 150 ) years ago by the collapse of the volcano Mount Mazama . There are no rivers flowing into or out of the lake ; the evaporation is compensated for by rain and snowfall at a rate such that the total amount of water is replaced every 250 years . With a depth of 1,949 feet ( 594 m ) , the lake is the deepest in the United States . In the world , it ranks ninth for maximum depth , and third for mean ( average ) depth . </P> <P> Crater Lake is also known for the `` Old Man of the Lake \\'\\' , a full - sized tree which is now a stump that has been bobbing vertically in the lake for over a century . The low temperature of the water has slowed the decomposition of the wood , hence the longevity of the bobbing tree . </P> <P> Two islands are in Crater Lake : Wizard Island , formed from a cinder cone that erupted after Crater Lake began to fill with water , and the smaller Phantom Ship , which has seven trees living on it . There are also colonies of violet - green swallows and several varieties of wildflowers and lichens living there . </P> <P> While having no indigenous fish population , the lake was stocked from 1888 to 1941 with a variety of fish . Several species have formed self - sustaining populations . Since 2002 , one of the state \\'s regular - issue license plate designs has featured Crater Lake .

The ancestral Dogue de Bordeaux had various coat colors , such as brindle and a majority of white markings that carried fully up the legs . It had scissor bites in some regions , undershot in others ; a big head or a small head , a large body or a small body ; very inconsistent in type . Another controversial aspect was the mask , red ( brown ) , none or black . The Dogue de Bordeaux of Bordeaux of the time also sported cropped ears . Regardless , it had a general type similar to today 's Dogue de Bordeaux . </P> <H3> Breeding ( edit ) </H3> Dogue de Bordeaux <P> In 1863 , the first canine exhibition was held at the `` Jardin d'Acclimatation '' in Paris , France . The winner of the Dogue de Bordeaux was a female named Magentas . The Dogue de Bordeaux was then given the name of the capital of its region of origin , today 's Dogue de Bordeaux . </P> <P> During the 1960s , a group of breeders of the Dogue de Bordeaux in France , headed by Raymond Triquet , worked on the rebuilding of the foundation of the breed . In 1970 , a new standard was written for the breed , with the most recent update in 1995 . This standard is the basis of the standard written for the AKC in 2005 . </P> <P> Although the Dogue de Bordeaux first arrived in the USA in the 1890s for the show ring , the first documented Dogues de Bordeaux of modern times appeared in 1959 , Fidelle de Fenelon ; and in 1968 , Rugby de la Maison des Arbres . Between 1969 and 1980 , imported Dogues de Bordeaux in the USA were scarce , limited to a few breeders who worked closely with the French Dogue de Bordeaux Club , the SADB . The breed was first `` officially '' introduced to American purebred enthusiasts in an article written in 1982 and by the American anthropologist , Dr. Carl Semencic for `` Dog World '' magazine . That article , entitled `` Introducing the Dogue de Bordeaux '' , was followed by chapters dedicated to the Dogue in Semencic 's books on dogs , published by T.F.H. Publications of Neptune , New Jersey . When Semencic 's first article on the breed was published , there were no Bordeaux Dogues in the United States . There were 600 examples left in the world , mostly in France , the Netherlands and East Berlin , and the breed 's numbers were on the decline .
